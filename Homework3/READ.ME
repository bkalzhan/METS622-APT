# Homework3 - Article Search Project

## Overview
This project implements various search algorithms for retrieving articles based on keywords. It includes three approaches: **Brute Force Search**, **Apache Lucene**, and **Skip List Search**. The project also features an **Inverted Index** implementation to enhance search efficiency and improve response times.

## Features
- **Brute Force Search**: A straightforward search method iterating through all articles to find matches.
- **Apache Lucene**: A powerful search engine library for indexing and searching articles efficiently.
- **Skip List Search**: A probabilistic data structure that allows for fast search operations.
- **Inverted Index**: A data structure that maps keywords to their respective articles, enabling quick lookup.
- **Response Time Measurement**: Each search method includes functionality to measure and print response times.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Apache Lucene library

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Prepare your data:**
Use the DownloadPartialXML.java class to extract a subset of articles from larger XML files.
Modify the class to customize the extraction based on your specific data needs. Ensure the extracted XML structure aligns with the expected format for articles in this project.
3. **Run the Query Example:**
Execute the QueryExample.java class to see the response times for each search algorithm.
You can modify the query parameters in this class to test different keywords and article limits.
